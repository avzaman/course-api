# Course Management System
This project is a course managment system. It provides a web UI to make requests to a RESTful API to add new courses to the program and see what programs are available.

### Getting Started
This project is based off of [this course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msXL2oDexqw&list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTbx8p2oCgcAQGQyqN8XeA1x&index=2) on youtube published by Java Brains.
It is a very useful introduction to Spring and Spring Boot and allows for any Java savvy developer to spin up a server with ease.<br>
<br>
The technologies I learned from this project are:

- Spring Boot (Java framework)
- REST APIs
- Maven (build tool / dependency manager)
- Insomnia (REST API dev tool)
